            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                The Egyptian Red Crescent was established in 1911 as a humanitarian organization dedicated to providing
                aid and relief during times of crisis.
                Over the decades, it has played a vital role in disaster response, health services, and community
                support across Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guided by the principles of neutrality, impartiality, and humanity, the organization has been a beacon
                of hope for millions.
                From responding to natural disasters to offering medical assistance during conflicts, the Egyptian Red
                Crescent continues to uphold its mission of serving those in need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the organization works in collaboration with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent
                Movement, ensuring global solidarity and support for humanitarian efforts.
